# Etere Documentation 
This page describes etereshop controller software.
During time this software changed multiple times, this documentation version describes 8th software version.  
Due to backwards compatibility this instructions can be applied to previous software versions.

## STANDART CONTROL

<details> <summary>Specification</summary>
Available for controllers:

    -ESP8266
    -ESP32
    
With this type of control, changing the effects is carried out by pressing the buttons of the controller itself   
    
### Simple mode

<details> <summary>Description</summary>

For a simple stand-alone mode with switching the effect using a button, the configuration file should contain the following line:

    play.default=0;

    or

    play.default=Manual;

    or nothing
</details>

### Auto-switch mode

<details> <summary>Description</summary>
When the mode is active, your controller will cycle through effects in an endless loop every N seconds.
To activate this mode, set the following line in the configuration file:

    play.default=2;

    or

    play.default=Auto;

You also need to create an `auto.txt` file and write the time value in milliseconds to this file. Example: 

    15000 - effects will switch every 15 seconds.

To activate automatic switching of effects after turning on the product, you just need to press the button of the switching effect.

To activate the blackout effect, you need to press and hold any button for about 1.5-2 seconds.
Blackout effect - the effect at which all LEDs go out

> **Note:** LEDs continue to consume power while playing the blackout effect
</details>

### Playlist mode

<details> <summary>Description</summary>
You also can program your own show. 
To activate this mode, set the following line in the configuration file:

    play.default=1;
    
    or
    
    play.default=Playlist;

Also, you need to create an auto.txt file and write the number of effects and the time when the effect should be switched after the start of the show in this file. The show starts after clicking the switch effect button.
    
`show.txt` file example:
    
    1, 0:00
    2, 0:10			| Effect with the name S2 can't be found on sd Card -> ignoring
    3, 0:25			| Activate effect S3 after 25 seconds from click.
    0, 0:30			| Activate blackout at 30th second from click.
    4, 0:31			| Activate S4 at second 31
    12, 0:35:541		| Activate S12 at 35.541
    1, 40100		| Activate S1 in 41.1 seconds after click (time in msec)
    0, 0:50			| Activate blackout at 50th second
    3, 1:05			| Activate S3 at 1:05, this effect will be active until you turn off the controller.

How it works:

    Set S1 effect at the start (0th second) from button click
    Set S2 effect at 10th second.
    Set S3 effect at 25th second.
    Set blackout effect at 30th second.
    ...
    
Remember to set the dimming effect (number 0) at the end if you want to turn off the LEDs at the end of the show.    
To do this, press and hold the button for about 1.5-2 seconds.

If the controller cannot find an effect by the sequence number specified in the playlist, that effect will be ignored. The previous effect will continue to play.
</details>

### Test mode

<details> <summary>Description</summary>
Service mode for testing and detecting problems with LEDs.

> **Note:** This mode is not custom

    play.default=3;
    or
    play.default=Test;
</details>   
</details>




## RADIO CONTROL
    
<details> <summary>Specification</summary>  
Radio control is an extension of the standard control.
    
To enable the radio, add the following line to the configuration file:

   - if the controller should only listen to the radio channel;

       `radio.pattern=input;`

   - if the controller only needs to send a radio signal to other receivers;
    
       `radio.pattern=output;`

   - if the controller must simultaneously listen to the radio and send it to other receivers;

       `radio.pattern=group;` 

The radio signal only transmits the effect number. If the controller receives this value, it must change the current effect number to the received number and play that effect assuming that it exists on the controller's memory card.
    
In output mode and group mode, the controller will send the effect value if it was changed by pressing the effect switch button (not applicable to special transmitter controllers such as DMX-RF 20-button remote controller).    
    
### Radio module settings
    
<details> <summary>Description</summary>

If you have several groups of radio-controlled LED products and want to control them independently, you can change the radio channels. Signals from different channels do not overlap with each other.
    
To change the radio channel, you need to add the following line to the config file:

`radio.channel=#;`

Where # is the number of the channel that can range from 1 to 127.

Default channel is 1;

</details>
    
### Advanced settings    

<details> <summary>Description</summary>

You can also create virtual subchannels. This option has been added to use multiple DMX channels to control LED products with a DMX-RF transmitter.

Advanced settings are activated by adding the following code to the config file:

`radio.version=1;`

The number of subchannels is regulated by the following line:
    
`radio.v1.bits=#;`    
    
Where # - subchannel mode, it must be between 1 and 4:
    
    - If 1: up to 2 subchannels but 127 numbers of effects max.
    - If 2: up to 4 subchannels but 63 numbers of effects max.
    - If 3: up to 8 subchannels but 31 numbers of effects max.
    - If 4: up to 16 subchannels but 15 numbers of effects max.
    
All receivers must have the same settings. If the transmitter sends a radio signal to 5 receivers, then each receiver should have 
    radio.v1.bits = 3 (4 < 5 < 8).

`radio.v1.address=0;`
Subchannel address for the receiver.
    - If radio.v1.bits=1 then value in range from 0 to 1;
    - If radio.v1.bits=2 then value in range from 0 to 3;
    - If radio.v1.bits=3 then value in range from 0 to 7;
    - If radio.v1.bits=4 then value in range from 0 to 15;
    
`radio.v1.reset=0;`
Blackout/stop value. We recommend that you do not change this value.

`radio.v1.output=[0,1];`
Output address [addr,addr,addr] for output and group modes.

</details>

### Integration with standalone modes    

<details> <summary>Description</summary>    

Simple standalone mode
Works autonomously as usual. In radio group mode or output mode, if you press a button to change the effect, the controller also sends a signal to other LED products to change the effect to the same number.
The number of effects must be the same on each controller, otherwise switching to the missing effect will be ignored. A long press on the button will stop the effects playback.

Auto and show/playlist mode

A short press of the button sends a signal to start playback of the sequence to each controller-listener. A long press on the button will stop the effects playback.

</details>

Possible types of radio transmitters:
    
   <details> <summary>Description</summary>     
    
   - Twenty button console
    
        <details> <summary>Description</summary> 
  
        ![image](images/Twenty_button_console.jpg) 
        
        The remote control consists of: a controller box unit with 20 buttons, an external radio antenna 433MHz, a power bank, a USB cable.    
        
        There are 2 versions of the remote control: for 20 effects and for 36 effects.

        Version with 20 effects: each button triggers one effect from 1 to 20.

        Version with 36 effects: 
            
            18 buttons for switching effects, 2 buttons for setting page 1 or 2. 
            If page #1 is selected: buttons 1-18 → effects 1-18. 
            If page # 2 is selected: buttons 1-18 → effects 19-36.
            
        The radio channel cannot be changed by hardware restrictions.

### WiFi settings for config.txt file
    
<details> <summary>Description</summary>    

`wifi.mode=sta;`
    
`'sta'` or `'ap'`. This means that the controller must be connected to the user’s Wi-Fi hotspot, otherwise, the controller will create its own hotspot with the parameters shown below. We recommend using the `"sta"` mode.
Warning! Signal quality and network stability largely depend on the hardware of your access point! A regular cheap home router may not be enough for your tasks.

`wifi.ssid=Point1234;`
Access point name.

`wifi.password=pass4321;`
Access point password.

`wifi.ip=192.168.1.99;`
IP address of controller in network.

`wifi.netmask=255.255.255.0;`
Standard network mask, no need to change in most situations.

`wifi.gateway=192.168.1.1;`
Same as IP, but the last number may be any from 0 to 255. The gateway is only needed to work over the Internet. There is no internet functionality at this moment.

`play.defaultPlayMode=4;`
or
`play.defaultPlayMode=Art-Net;`
Sets this mode as default mode.

</details>

</details>      
    
    
## LAN REAL-TIME CONTROL        
    
<details> <summary>Specification</summary> 
   
Only is supported by ESP32.

Limitations: 4760 LEDs or 28 universes for stable operation, but more than 40 universes are possible (6800 LEDs).
    
Warning! More LEDs -> less stability and lower frame rates -> more freezes or controller reboots.


### LAN Settings for config.txt file

`wifi.mode=eth;`
Enable LAN hardware.

`wifi.ip=192.168.1.99;`
IP address of controller within the network.

`wifi.netmask=255.255.255.0;`
Standard network mask, no need to change it in most situations.

`wifi.gateway=192.168.1.1;`
Same as IP, but the last number may be any from 0 to 255. The gateway is only needed to work over the Internet. There is no internet functionality at this moment.

`play.defaultPlayMode=4;` or `play.defaultPlayMode=Art-Net;`
    
Sets this mode as default mode.
    
</details>    

## DMX CONTROLER

<details> <summary>Specification</summary> 
    
To switch effects via a DMX device, a Teensy 3.2 controller is used with two male XLR connectors with 3 and 5 pins respectively, a microSD card, LED indication, a 433 MHz radio module, and an external antenna.

The controller comes in 2 firmware versions:
    
   - control with 1 DMX channel (old);
   - control using 1-16 DMX channels (has limitations).

Restrictions of the second option depending on the number of channels:
    
    - 1 channel - supports up to 255 effects
    - 2 channels - supports up to 127 effects
    - 3-4 channels - supports up to 63 effects
    - 5-8 channels - supports up to 31 effects
    - 9-16 channels - supports up to 16 effects

### DMX channel settings
The controller memory card contains the “channel.txt” file. The DMX channel number should be specified in the range of [1-512], each channel should be specified on a new line, and the number of channels should not exceed 16 pieces.

Example:
    
![image](images/DMX.jpg)

### Radio channel settings
If for some reason the first radio channel is occupied by another device, you can change the channel of this transmitter by creating a file “config.txt”. In it, you must specify the channel number from 1 to 127. In this case, the channel of the receiving device must also be changed. See the appropriate section for ESP8266 or ESP32 controllers.

LED indication:
    
    - red - microSD card not found;
    - dull red at the start - microSD card found but there is no "channel.txt" file;
    - yellow - errors in channel.txt file.

</details>    

## MICROPHONE MODE

<details> <summary>Specification</summary> 

![image](images/DMX.jpg)

Only available with ESP8266.

Restrictions:
    
   - 1 button to switch effects instead of 2 by default;
   - Reduces the number of LED outputs by 1.

2 microphone modes:
    
   - Response of standalone effects to sound
   - Sound animation.

### Response of standalone effects to sound

Regular standalone effects can react to sound in terms of brightness and speed.

Add next rows to the config file:

    device.1=mic(17);
    update.set=led.brightness, device.1.1, 5,100;
    update.set=play.speed, device.1.1, 150,512;
    button.count=1;
    button.1=digital(10,pull_up)[Switch 1,1000 Reset];

Only one effect switch button will be available for use. The only thing you can change is the action for this button. The rest of the parameter values are optimal for current hardware.
But you can change the last two values for update.set parameter for brightness and speed 5 – minimum brightness (range: 0-99), 100 – maximum brightness (range: 1-100), 150 – minimum speed (range:0-511), 512 – maximum speed (range:1-512).

### Sound animation

The controller with the microphone must have next lines of code in the config file:
    
    button.count=1;
    button.1=digital(10,pull_up)[Switch 1,1000 Reset];
    device.1=mic(17,200,60,49000,2100,5000);

Only one effect switch button will be available for use. The only thing you can change is the action for this button. The rest of the parameter values are optimal for current hardware.


Also, you need to create a file A1.txt in the root folder (in the same place where the config.txt file is stored):

    version=1;
    device=device.1.1;
    frametime=100;
    
Also, you need to create a folder named anim in the root folder. Create a folder named A1 in the anim folder and save the images that you want to see as your effects in it. Images must be in .bmp format with a resolution equal to that of the LED patch resolution. BMP images must have numbered names starting from number 1 (1.bmp, 2.bmp ...). Images must have 24-bit color depth (check the parameter in a graphics editor).
